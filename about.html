    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Wada Mehari, the host of the Push-Pull competition. I am a state and national record holder for the 'Women's Raw Drug Tested Juniors (20-23) 60kg class'. As an international student from Ethiopia, I discovered the power of
      strength training through my close friend and mentor, Joya Drenth. Inspired by her strength and dedication, I began my
      own fitness journey, and now, I’m passionate about creating a community where others can also find empowerment
      through fitness.</p>
